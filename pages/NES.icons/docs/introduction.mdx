NES.icons was designed to be a complement to [NES.css][nes.css], providing an icon set that matched the aesthetic of the framework.

Through several iterations, we've created a framework that we're super proud of! NES.icons provides a set of 8-bit, NES-style icons for use in your project. This includes several popular brand logos and a whole swathe of common interface elements.

If you're ready to dig in, let's get started!
